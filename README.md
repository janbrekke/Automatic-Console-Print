# Automatic-Console-Print
This will make a function that can make it look like
tekst are being typed into the console automatically.

# Usage
To make it work you need to add the definition somewhere into the top of your code.
Then you can use it as you would use the normal print function.

EX: consoleprint("Hello GITHUB World..")

The text will be printed as if it was typed by someone.
Speed can also be changed.
